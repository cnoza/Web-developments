## About me

I've been doing web development since 1999! Not continuously though, mainly out of passion for web technologies and creating new designs.  Back in 1999, I started with plain HTML/CSS, then moved to PHP/MySQL.  I then learned using Wordpress, created plugins, etc.  Today, I'm getting up to date with the latest trend: Bootstrap, CSS grid, Angular, jQuery, NodeJS, etc.  I've created this repository to track everything I'm learning on these topics.
