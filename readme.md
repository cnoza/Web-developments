# Web developments

## About me

I've been doing web development since 1999, out of passion. Back in 1999, I started with plain HTML/CSS and the Notepad editor, then moved to PHP and learned how to use databases (MySQL, PhpMyAdmin).  I then learned Wordpress, how to create plugins and customize Wordpress themes, how to integrate WP with other systems using webservices, etc.  

Today, I'm getting up to date with the latest technologies in Front-/Back-end web developments: Bootstrap, CSS grid, Angular, jQuery, NodeJS, ReactJS, etc.  I've created this repository as a sandbox.
